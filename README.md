# Battleship Game
When I first learned programming in 2015, I started with Python and I had a plenty of fun with it.

I developed a battleship game that is based on http://en.battleship-game.org/.
This game allow users to play in 3 different levels of difficulty against AI.

This is my first programming project, so I might not have done a great job implementing it but I still had fun building it.
